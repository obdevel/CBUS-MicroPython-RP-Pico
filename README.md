# CBUS in MicroPython on the RP Pico RP2040

A set of MicroPython code modules to create a MERG CBUS module and layout automation programs.

The target platform is the Raspberry Pi Pico and a CAN bus adapter, although any platform supported by MicroPython should be compatible.

Several examples are provided as well as a getting started guide.

Simply upload all the files to the root directory (/) of the Pico and then enter 'import module_example' at the REPL prompt.

The basic CBUS module code has been extensively tested.
